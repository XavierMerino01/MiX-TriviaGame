# MiX Game

## About The Project

This project originated as an anniversary present for my girlfriend, and using the opportunity to showcase my game development skills. Over the course of two weeks, I dedicated myself to creating a game that balanced simplicity with quality code architecture.

After the first personal version was finished, I took some more time to refine and optimize the game, with the goal of finally including it in my professional portfolio.

## Gameplay
The game starts giving players the option to choose between three characters in the Main Menu: a duck, a bear, and a dog, created by KayLousberg and available for use on itch.io. 

The objective of the game is to collect as many blue diamonds as possible, unlocking rewards along the way. To acquire diamonds, players must engage in a series of challenges, including trivia-style games and a "complete the room" puzzles.
