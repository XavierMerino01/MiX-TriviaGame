## About The Project

The main purpose of this game was to use it as an anniversary present for my girlfriend. 
I developed it in a couple weeks and tried to keep it simple, but made the effort to write a decent and reusable code. 
The goal of the game is to colect as many blue diamonds as posible and get rewards for them, to then use those to complete another part of the game. 
To get diamonds the player needs to complete a couple of Trivia-like games and a "complete the room" puzzle, in which he has to find and place the correct items into the corresponding furniture object.
